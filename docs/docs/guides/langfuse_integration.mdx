# Integrating Langfuse with Langflow

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Create a Langfuse account

1. Go to [https://langfuse.com](https://langfuse.com) and click on the "Sign In" button in the top right corner.
2. Click on the "Sign Up" button and create an account.
3. Click on "Settings" and then on "Create new API keys"
4. Copy the Public key and the Secret Key and save them somewhere safe.
   {/* Add env variables LANGFLOW_LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY, LANGFLOW_LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY and LANGFLOW_LANGFUSE_HOST to pass to CallbackHandler */}

### Step 2: Set up Langfuse in Langflow

1. Export the environment variables LANGFLOW_LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY, LANGFLOW_LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY with the values from step 1.

You can do this by executing the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
export LANGFLOW_LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=<your secret key>
export LANGFLOW_LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=<your public key>
```

or by running the Langflow CLI command:

```bash
LANGFLOW_LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=<your secret key> LANGFLOW_LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=<your public key> langflow
```

That's it! Now, whenever you use Langflow's chat feature, you will be able to see the tracing of your conversations in Langfuse.
