# üñ•Ô∏è Flows, components, collections, and projects

## TL;DR

A [flow](#flow) is a pipeline of components connected together in the Langflow canvas.

A [component](#component) is a single building block within a flow. A component has inputs, outputs, and parameters that define its functionality.

A [collection](#collection) is a snapshot of the flows available in your database. Collections can be downloaded to local storage and uploaded for future use.

A [project](#project) can be a component or a flow. Projects are saved as part of your collection.

For example, the **OpenAI LLM** is a **component** of the **Basic prompting** flow, and the **flow** is stored in a **collection**.

## Flow

A **flow** is a pipeline of components connected together in the Langflow canvas.

For example, the [Basic prompting](../starter-projects/basic-prompting.mdx) flow is a pipeline of four components:

<ZoomableImage
  alt="Docusaurus themed image"
  sources={{
    light: "img/basic-prompting.png",
    dark: "img/basic-prompting.png",
  }}
  style={{ width: "80%", margin: "20px auto" }}
/>

For example, the **OpenAI LLM component** receives input (left side) and produces output (right side) - in this case, receiving input from the **Chat Input** and **Prompt** components and producing output to the **Chat Output** component.

## Component

Components are the building blocks of flows. They consist of inputs, outputs, and parameters that define their functionality. These elements provide a convenient and straightforward way to compose LLM-based applications. Learn more about components and how they work in the LangChain [documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/components).

<div style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
  During the flow creation process, you will notice handles (colored circles)
  attached to one or both sides of a component. These handles represent the
  availability to connect to other components. Hover over a handle to see connection details.
</div>

<div style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
  For example, if you select a <code>ConversationChain</code> component, you
  will see orange <span style={{ color: "orange" }}>o</span> and purple{" "}
  <span style={{ color: "purple" }}>o</span> input handles. They indicate that
  this component accepts an LLM and a Memory component as inputs. The red
  asterisk <span style={{ color: "red" }}>*</span> means that at least one input
  of that type is required.
</div>

<ZoomableImage
  alt="Docusaurus themed image"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl("img/single-component.png"),
    dark: useBaseUrl("img/single-component.png"),
  }}
  style={{ width: "50%", maxWidth: "800px", margin: "20px auto" }}
/>

<div style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
In the top right corner of the component, you'll find the component status icon (![Status icon](/logos/playbutton.svg)).
Build the flow by clicking the **![Playground icon](/logos/botmessage.svg)Playground** at the bottom right of the canvas.

Once the validation is complete, the status of each validated component should turn green (![Status icon](/logos/greencheck.svg)).
To debug, hover over the component status to see the outputs.
</div>

### Component Parameters

Langflow components can be edited by clicking the component settings button. Hide parameters to reduce complexity and keep the canvas clean and intuitive for experimentation.

<div
  style={{ marginBottom: "20px", display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}
>
  <ReactPlayer playing controls url="/videos/langflow_parameters.mp4" />
</div>


## Collection

A collection is a snapshot of flows available in a database.

Collections can be downloaded to local storage and uploaded for future use.

<div style={{ marginBottom: '20px', display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
<ReactPlayer playing controls url='/videos/langflow_collection.mp4'
  />
</div>

## Project

A **Project** can be a flow or a component. To view your saved projects, select **My Collection**.

Your **Projects** are displayed.

Click the **![Playground icon](/logos/botmessage.svg) Playground** button to run a flow from the **My Collection** screen.

In the top left corner of the screen are options for **Download Collection**, **Upload Collection**, and **New Project**.

Select **Download Collection** to save your project to your local machine. This downloads all flows and components as a `.json` file.

Select **Upload Collection** to upload a flow or component `.json` file from your local machine.

Select **New Project** to create a new project. In addition to a blank canvas, [starter projects](../starter-projects/basic-prompting.mdx) are also available.
