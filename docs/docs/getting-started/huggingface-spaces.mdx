# ðŸ¤— HuggingFace Spaces

HuggingFace provides a great alternative for running Langflow in their Spaces environment. This means you can run Langflow without any local installation required.

In a Chromium-based browser, go to the [Langflow Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Langflow/Langflow?duplicate=true) or [Langflow v1.0 alpha Preview Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Langflow/Langflow-Preview?duplicate=true).

You'll be presented with the following screen:

<ZoomableImage
  alt="Docusaurus themed image"
  sources={{
    light: "img/duplicate-space.png",
    dark: "img/duplicate-space.png",
  }}
  style={{ width: "100%", margin: "20px auto" }}
/>

Name your Space, define the visibility (Public or Private), and click on **Duplicate Space** to start the installation process. When installation is finished, you'll be redirected to the Space's main page to start using Langflow right away!
