# ðŸŽ¨ Creating Flows

## Compose

Creating flows with Langflow is easy. Drag sidebar components onto the canvas and connect them together to create your pipeline.
Langflow provides a range of Components to choose from, including **Chat Input**, **Chat Output**, **API Request** and **Prompt**.

<ZoomableImage
  alt="Docusaurus themed image"
  sources={{
    light: "img/langflow_canvas.png",
    dark: "img/langflow_canvas.png"
  }}
/>

## Starter Flows

Langflow provides a range of starter flows to help you get started. These flows are pre-built and can be used as a starting point for your own flows.

<div
  style={{ marginBottom: "20px", display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}
>
  <ReactPlayer playing controls url="/videos/langflow_fork.mp4" />
</div>

## Defining Inputs and Outputs

Each flow can have multiple inputs and outputs. These can be defined by placing **Inputs** and **Outputs** components on the canvas.

The **Inputs** components define the inputs to the flow.
Whenever you place an Input component on the canvas, it will allow you to interactively define change its value
from the Interactive Panel.

The **Text Input** component allows you to define a text input, and the **Chat Input** component allows you to use the chat input from the Interactive Panel.

The **Outputs** components define the outputs of the flow and work similarly to the Inputs components.

Both Inputs and Outputs components can be connected to other components on the canvas and are used to define how the API works too.



<div
  style={{ marginBottom: "20px", display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}

  <ReactPlayer playing controls url="/videos/langflow_build.mp4" />
</div>
