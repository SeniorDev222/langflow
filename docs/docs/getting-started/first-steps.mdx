# First steps

## Installation

Make sure you have **Python 3.10** installed on your system.

You can install **Langflow** with [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/) or with pip.

Pipx can fetch the missing Python version for you, but you can also install it manually.

```bash
pipx install langflow --python python3.10 --fetch-missing-python
# or
pip install langflow -U
```

Or you can install a pre-release version using:

```bash
pipx install langflow --python python3.10 --fetch-missing-python --pip-args="--pre"
# or
pip install langflow --pre -U
```

##‚õìÔ∏è Running Langflow

Langflow can be run in a variety of ways, including using the command-line interface (CLI) or HuggingFace Spaces.

```bash
langflow run # or langflow --help
```

### ü§ó HuggingFace Spaces

Hugging Face provides a great alternative for running Langflow in their Spaces environment. This means you can run Langflow without any local installation required.

The first step is to go to the [Langflow Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Logspace/Langflow?duplicate=true). Remember to use a Chromium-based browser for the best experience. You‚Äôll be presented with the following screen:
From here, just name your Space, define the visibility (Public or Private), and click on `Duplicate Space` to start the installation process. When that is done, you‚Äôll be redirected to the Space‚Äôs main page to start using Langflow right away!

Once you get Langflow running, click on New Project in the top right corner of the screen. Langflow provides a range of example flows to help you get started.

To quickly try one of them, open a starter example and click ‚ö° Run, on the bottom right corner of the canvas. This will open up Langflow‚Äôs Interaction Panel with the chat console, text inputs, and outputs.


### üñ•Ô∏è Command Line Interface (CLI)

Langflow provides a command-line interface (CLI) for easy management and configuration.

#### Usage

You can run the Langflow using the following command:

```bash
langflow run [OPTIONS]
```

Each option is detailed below:

- `--help`: Displays all available options.
- `--host`: Defines the host to bind the server to. Can be set using the `LANGFLOW_HOST` environment variable. The default is `127.0.0.1`.
- `--workers`: Sets the number of worker processes. Can be set using the `LANGFLOW_WORKERS` environment variable. The default is `1`.
- `--timeout`: Sets the worker timeout in seconds. The default is `60`.
- `--port`: Sets the port to listen on. Can be set using the `LANGFLOW_PORT` environment variable. The default is `7860`.
- `--config`: Defines the path to the configuration file. The default is `config.yaml`.
- `--env-file`: Specifies the path to the .env file containing environment variables. The default is `.env`.
- `--log-level`: Defines the logging level. Can be set using the `LANGFLOW_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable. The default is `critical`.
- `--components-path`: Specifies the path to the directory containing custom components. Can be set using the `LANGFLOW_COMPONENTS_PATH` environment variable. The default is `langflow/components`.
- `--log-file`: Specifies the path to the log file. Can be set using the `LANGFLOW_LOG_FILE` environment variable. The default is `logs/langflow.log`.
- `--cache`: Select the type of cache to use. Options are `InMemoryCache` and `SQLiteCache`. Can be set using the `LANGFLOW_LANGCHAIN_CACHE` environment variable. The default is `SQLiteCache`.
- `--dev/--no-dev`: Toggles the development mode. The default is `no-dev`.
- `--path`: Specifies the path to the frontend directory containing build files. This option is for development purposes only. Can be set using the `LANGFLOW_FRONTEND_PATH` environment variable.
- `--open-browser/--no-open-browser`: Toggles the option to open the browser after starting the server. Can be set using the `LANGFLOW_OPEN_BROWSER` environment variable. The default is `open-browser`.
- `--remove-api-keys/--no-remove-api-keys`: Toggles the option to remove API keys from the projects saved in the database. Can be set using the `LANGFLOW_REMOVE_API_KEYS` environment variable. The default is `no-remove-api-keys`.
- `--install-completion [bash|zsh|fish|powershell|pwsh]`: Installs completion for the specified shell.
- `--show-completion [bash|zsh|fish|powershell|pwsh]`: Shows completion for the specified shell, allowing you to copy it or customize the installation.
- `--backend-only`: This parameter, with a default value of `False`, allows running only the backend server without the frontend. It can also be set using the `LANGFLOW_BACKEND_ONLY` environment variable.
- `--store`: This parameter, with a default value of `True`, enables the store features, use `--no-store` to deactivate it. It can be configured using the `LANGFLOW_STORE` environment variable.

These parameters are important for users who need to customize the behavior of Langflow, especially in development or specialized deployment scenarios.

### Environment Variables

You can configure many of the CLI options using environment variables. These can be exported in your operating system or added to a `.env` file and loaded using the `--env-file` option.

A sample `.env` file named `.env.example` is included with the project. Copy this file to a new file named `.env` and replace the example values with your actual settings. If you're setting values in both your OS and the `.env` file, the `.env` settings will take precedence.
