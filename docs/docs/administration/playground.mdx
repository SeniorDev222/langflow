# Playground

In Langflow 1.0 alpha, the **Playground** replaces the **Integration Window**.

The **Playground** offers an interface for interacting with chat flows.

1. To use the **Playground**, from your **Collections** page, click **Playground** in one of your flows.
The **Playground** window opens.

<ZoomableImage
  alt="Docusaurus themed image"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl("img/playground-chat.png"),
    dark: useBaseUrl("img/playground-chat.png"),
  }}
  style={{ width: "50%", maxWidth: "600px", margin: "0 auto" }}
/>

2. Chat with your bot as you normally would.

The Playground allows you to run flows without opening them in the flow editor.
This applies to the Langflow store, too - as long as you have your global environment variables set, you can run flows by clicking the **Playground** button.
