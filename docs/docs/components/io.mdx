## StoreMessages

**Params**

- **records:** (Optional) Specifies the list of records to store. Each `Record` should contain the keys `'sender'`, `'sender_name'`, and `'session_id'`. If not provided, `texts` must be used along with `session_id`, `sender`, and `sender_name` to construct the records.

- **texts:** (Optional) Specifies the list of text messages to store. If `records` is not provided, `texts` must be provided along with `session_id`, `sender`, and `sender_name`.

- **session_id:** (Optional) Specifies the session ID associated with the messages. Required if `records` is not provided and `texts` are used.

- **sender:** (Optional) Specifies the identifier of the sender. Required if `records` is not provided and `texts` are used.

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">
    <p>
        The component prioritizes the use of `records` for storing messages. If `records` are not provided, it requires `texts`, `session_id`, `sender`, and `sender_name` to construct and store records. Ensure that either `records` or the combination of `texts`, `session_id`, `sender`, and `sender_name` is provided.
